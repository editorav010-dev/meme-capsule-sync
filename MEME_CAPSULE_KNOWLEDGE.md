          MEME CAPSULE — CORE PRODUCT QUESTIONS & AUTHORITATIVE ANSWERS
================================================================================
```

### Q1: What is Meme Capsule?
**Meme Capsule** is an anti-algorithm, single-action meme delivery platform engineered for immediate entertainment without feeds, doomscrolling, or social clutter.
- **Public Mobile Product:** A native Android application (`com.meme.capsule`, current version `v2.7` / `versionCode 18`) available on Google Play. Built with React 19, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, and Capacitor 8, it operates like a digital arcade vending machine: tapping the **`HIT ME`** button dispenses exactly one hand-screened, high-variance meme onto a 4-card 3D perspective spring stack.
- **Public Web Platform:** A multi-page, statically prerendered web platform at [https://memecapsule.wtf](https://memecapsule.wtf) featuring a live interactive drop preview simulator (with a 5-drop quota and Google Play install bumper), 3D interactive phone mockups with authentic WebP screenshots, Section 04.5 "Under the Hood" technical transparency, an official `/about` Press Kit, and Google AdSense monetization (`meme1`).
- **Developer / Serverless Edge Backend:** A serverless edge architecture on Cloudflare Pages (`https://meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev`), Cloudflare D1 (SQLite database), and Cloudflare R2 (media bucket), coupled with Neo-Brutalist internal tools for human multi-judge curation (`/curate`), admin database syncing (`/admin`), user safety moderation (`/reports`), and AI-assisted pre-evaluation (`/ai-judge`).

### Q2: Why does Meme Capsule exist?
Modern internet culture is trapped inside social media feeds (Instagram, TikTok, X, Reddit) controlled by recommendation algorithms that optimize for watch time, outrage, repetitive trends, and sponsored posts. Users spend 45 minutes doomscrolling just to encounter two genuinely funny memes. Meme Capsule was created to restore the original magic of internet humor: instant, surprise-driven, zero-friction entertainment with no tracking, no accounts, and no algorithmic manipulation.

### Q3: What problem is it trying to solve?
1. **Algorithmic Fatigue & Doomscrolling:** Eliminates feed-induced sensory overload and screen addiction by replacing continuous vertical scroll with deliberate, discrete single-capsule drops.
2. **Quality Dilution & Repost Slop:** Fixes the low-effort repost problem by curating memes through a multi-stage pipeline: staging via Google Drive, automated multimodal AI pre-judging (Gemini Vision and NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 Vision), human multi-judge consensus, SuperAdmin arbitration, and community reporting.
3. **Saving & Sharing Friction:** Cleanly saving a meme on Android usually requires taking a screenshot, cropping black bars, or dealing with intrusive app watermarks. Meme Capsule features native Android MediaStore integration for instant, lossless 1-tap gallery saving without permission prompts, alongside a custom Neo-Brutalist Share Sheet with 6 animated social media dispatch buttons.
4. **Friction & Privacy Intrusion:** Eliminates logins, passwords, tracking cookies, and profile creation. The user opens the app or website and is instantly one tap away from humor.

### Q4: Who is Meme Capsule for?
- **Digital Natives & Group Chat Instigators (Gen Z & Millennials, Ages 18–28):** Users whose primary goal is finding fresh, non-stale memes to share directly into WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, and Instagram group chats before anyone else sees them.
- **Micro-Break Seekers (Ages 18–35):** Students, commuters, and software engineers who want a quick, punchy 30-second dopamine reset during code builds, transit rides, or study breaks without falling into a 45-minute doomscroll trap.
- **Meme Collectors & Curators:** Users who organize personal collections into categorized, color-coded **Mood Boards** ("Pinned Energy") for situational deployment.
- **Casual Android & Web Users:** Anyone seeking clean, ad-light humor with zero personal data extraction.

### Q5: How does Meme Capsule work?
1. **Public Mobile Flow:**
   - The user opens the app and sees an arcade-inspired neo-brutalist interface with a prominent central button: **HIT ME**.
   - Tapping `HIT ME` pops the next meme instantly from a 7-meme FIFO prefetch buffer while showing an arcade hacker decryption sequence.
   - The meme is presented on an interactive 4-card 3D perspective spring stack (`@react-spring/web` & `@use-gesture/react`). The user can Swipe Right (`keep`), Swipe Left (`skip`), Swipe Up (`save`), Double-Tap (`DANK!` shake + reaction stamp), or Long-Press for 600ms to download to their gallery.
   - Instant-touch overlay buttons (`38px × 38px` Download & Share on top-right, `34px × 34px` Report on bottom-right) and a 4-button CTA bar (**LIKE**, **VAULT**, **PIN**, **SHARE**) provide immediate one-tap utility.
   - Tapping **SHARE** opens the Neo-Brutalist Share Bottom Sheet with live thumbnail preview, an auto-attached promotional message with Google Play Store download link, and 6 animated social media SVG dispatch buttons (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, X, Telegram, Discord).
2. **Public Web Flow (`memecapsule.wtf`):**
   - Visitors explore an authentic live drop preview simulator with a 5-drop quota counter. After 5 drops, a conversion lockout bumper prompts Google Play app installation with UTM campaign tracking.
   - Visitors can tilt 3D interactive phone mockups showcasing real WebP screenshots, open a full-resolution lightbox zoom modal, review technical breakdowns under Section 04.5 "Under the Hood", access the official Press Kit on `/about`, and consult an expanded 15-question FAQ.
3. **Internal Backend Flow:**
   - Unreviewed memes ingested into Cloudflare D1 and R2 storage are assigned `status = 'archived'`, `is_active = 0`, and `curation_status = NULL` (Uncurated Backlog).
   - Human curators review memes in `/curate` using Layer 0 keyboard shortcuts (`K` Keep, `E` Exclude, `D` Duplicate, `L` Review Later).
   - Divergent judge votes surface in the SuperAdmin Command Center. ONLY memes authoritatively resolved as `keep` become `ACTIVE` (`status = 'active'`, `is_active = 1`, `curation_status = 'keep'`) and eligible for public capsule drops; rejected memes are strictly isolated under `curation_status = 'excluded'`.

### Q6: What are all of its major features?
- **Single-Tap Capsule Dispenser:** Discrete random meme delivery with zero feed or scroll.
- **4-Card 3D Perspective Stack:** Spring-physics gesture deck supporting Swipe Left/Right/Up, Double-Tap haptics, and Long-Press downloads.
- **7-Meme FIFO Background Prefetch Buffer:** Maintains 7 preloaded memes in memory for zero loading delay.
- **Hybrid Content Sourcing:** Cloudflare D1/R2 repository alternating every 3rd fetch (`totalMemesViewed % 3 === 0`) with Reddit (`meme-api.com/gimme`), strictly filtered for SFW non-spoiler media.
- **Instant-Touch Overlay Buttons:** `38px × 38px` Download & Share buttons executing on `onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` with debounce guards to prevent gesture conflicts.

- **Native MediaStore Downloader:** Custom Java bridge saving memes into `Pictures/Meme Capsule` with zero runtime storage permissions on Android 10+.
- **Targeted Social Share Intent Bridge:** `shareImageToApp()` targeting specific package names with automatic fallback to native chooser.
- **Meme Vault & Mood Boards:** Local offline favorites gallery (free tier limit 20, Pro unlimited) and color-coded themed binders ("Pinned Energy") with synchronized pinboard/favorites storage.
- **Arcade Hacker Decryption Console:** Terminal animations, erratic countdowns, and diagnostic logs (`CHECKING REDDIT RELAY...`, `HARVESTING D1 SHARDS...`).
- **Interactive Web Live Preview:** Web simulator on `memecapsule.wtf` with 5-drop quota counter, automated fallback recovery, and Google Play install bumper.
- **3D Interactive Phone Mockups:** 5 authentic Android app screenshots in modern WebP + JPEG format with mouse-tilt 3D physics and fullscreen lightbox zoom.

- **Expanded 15-Question FAQ:** Search-optimized accordion backed by `FAQPage` Schema.org JSON-LD markup.
- **Dedicated About & Press Kit (`/about`):** Entity definition, quick facts grid, one-liner copy kit with copy-to-clipboard buttons, and downloadable brand assets.
- **Google AdMob & AdSense Monetization:** Mobile interstitial ads every 4th meme + rewarded ads for bonus drops; web banner ad unit `meme1` (`slot 6291908699`, `ca-pub-2093403233028868`).
- **Pro Tier In-App Purchase:** One-time upgrade (`remove_ads_forever` via `@capgo/native-purchases`) unlocking Zero Ads, Unlimited Vault, and permanent Triple Drop access.
- **Multi-Judge Consensus & SuperAdmin Arbitration:** Human curation engine (`/curate`) with Layer 0 keyboard navigation and binding consensus arbitration.
- **3-Tier D1 Status Partitioning (Migration 012):** Explicit separation of Active Capsule (111), Superadmin Excluded (53), and Uncurated Backlog (4,947) across database, APIs, and `/admin` UI.
- **Admin Control Panel & SQL Runner (`/admin`):** 5-metric top stats bar, dedicated `[EXCLUDED]` filter tab, R2 binary uploads, R2-to-D1 sync, and analytics recalculation.
- **Token-Gated Safety Moderation (`/reports`):** Ingestion of user-flagged content (`POST /api/report`) with one-click soft-archival and `content_blacklist` enforcement.
- **Multimodal AI Pre-Curator Loop (`/ai-judge`):** Gemini Vision and Python NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 11B Vision pipeline categorizing humor mechanisms, topics, and safety.

### Q7: How is it technically built?
- **Mobile Native Wrapper:** Android app built with **Capacitor 8** wrapping a Vite 6 / React 19 SPA, extended with a custom Java native bridge (`MainActivity.java`).
- **Mobile Frontend:** React 19, TypeScript 5.8, Vite 6.2, Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`), `@react-spring/web`, `@use-gesture/react`.
- **Web Platform & Pre-rendering:** React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS v3, React Router DOM v6, static HTML pre-rendering via `vite-plugin-prerender` with deterministic `ReactSSRRenderer` for GitHub Actions CI.
- **Edge Backend:** **Cloudflare Pages Functions** running on V8 isolates with zero cold-start latency (`functions/api/*`, `functions/reports.ts`).
- **Database:** **Cloudflare D1** (serverless SQLite at the edge) with 13 production migrations.
- **Media Storage:** **Cloudflare R2** (S3-compatible object storage with **$0.00 egress fees**).
- **AI Evaluation Pipeline:** Multimodal Gemini Vision (`@google/genai`) on Cloudflare Functions and an offline Python runner executing **NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct**.
- **SEO / GEO / AEO:** 4 linked Schema.org JSON-LD entities (`WebSite`, `Organization`, `MobileApplication`, `FAQPage`), `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` protocols for frontier AI crawlers, and XML Sitemap.

### Q8: How does its backend work?
The backend is completely serverless. When a client calls `GET /api/random-meme`, a Cloudflare Pages Function queries Cloudflare D1 with an inner join on `meme_curation_final`:
```sql
SELECT m.* FROM memes m
INNER JOIN meme_curation_final f ON m.id = f.meme_id
WHERE m.is_active = 1 AND m.status = 'active' AND f.corpus_status = 'keep' AND m.random_key >= ?
ORDER BY m.random_key ASC LIMIT 1;
```
Any meme that is unfinalized, in judging, or excluded is mathematically impossible to retrieve via `/api/random-meme` or `/api/daily-meme`. Media assets are served directly from Cloudflare R2 via an edge CDN URL with global caching and zero egress charges.

### Q9: How does its AI system work?
- **Public Product:** **ZERO AI RECOMMENDATION ALGORITHMS.** Content delivery is randomized serendipity.
- **Internal Backend Pipeline:**
  1. Multimodal Gemini Vision (`gemini-1.5-flash`) powers `/api/ai-judge/classify.ts` for rapid in-dashboard pre-evaluation.
  2. An asynchronous Python pipeline (`categorise.py`) inspects raw memes in R2 using **NVIDIA NIM (Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct)**. It performs multimodal OCR, evaluates humor mechanisms (irony, absurdity, relatability), assigns topics and tone, flags NSFW or low-effort content, and outputs structured metadata that populates D1 for human superadmin approval.

### Q10: What makes the application different?
1. **Discrete Consumption vs. Infinite Loop:** One button and one capsule at a time. The deliberate absence of a feed forces focus onto a single punchline and gives users total control over their time.
2. **Neo-Brutalist Arcade Visuals:** Pitch-dark `#131313` background, high-voltage purple (`#9b30ff`), arcade gold (`#f4c300`), hot magenta pink (`#dd0061`), 2-4px solid black borders, and hard geometric offset drop shadows.
3. **Lossless Native Android Integration:** Custom Java bridge to `MediaStore` saving memes directly into `Pictures/Meme Capsule` without browser download prompts or watermarks, plus targeted intent sharing to WhatsApp, Instagram, Telegram, and Discord.
4. **Radical Technical Transparency:** Explains exactly how memes are fetched, curated, and stored directly on the website with zero corporate obfuscation.
5. **Zero-Account Privacy:** No user accounts, passwords, or tracking cookies.

### 3.4 Card Deck, Gestures & Instant-Touch Overlay Architecture
The card deck is orchestrated by `MemeStack.tsx` using `@react-spring/web` and `@use-gesture/react`:
- **3D Perspective Deck:** Renders up to 4 stacked cards with dynamic scale, z-index, and perspective offsets.
- **Swipe Gestures:**
  - *Swipe Right:* Casts a `keep` vote and triggers the next card.
  - *Swipe Left:* Casts a `skip` vote.
  - *Swipe Up:* Saves the meme directly to the user's Meme Vault.
- **Double-Tap Reaction:** Double-tapping anywhere on the active card triggers a haptic recoil shake (`.animate-shake`) and stamps a visual reaction tag (`DANK!`, `CRINGE!`, `SO REAL`).
- **600ms Long-Press:** Holding down on the card executes a direct gallery download via the native Java bridge.
- **Instant-Touch Overlay Buttons (`MemeCard.tsx`):**
  - Because `MemeStack` attaches gesture handlers to the card with `touch-action: none`, standard click events can be swallowed during drag initiation.
  - The top-right `38px × 38px` Download & Share buttons and the bottom-right `34px × 34px` Report button execute on `onPointerDown` / `onTouchStart` with a `useRef` timestamp guard (250ms debounce) and `pointer-events-none` on inner SVG icons so touches register on the very first contact.

### 3.5 Neo-Brutalist Viral Share Bottom Sheet & Social Dispatch System
When the user taps Share (from the card overlay, bottom CTA bar, Meme Vault, or Mood Boards), the app opens `ShareModal.tsx`:
1. **Payload & Promotional Message Preview:**
   - Displays a live meme thumbnail, `1 Image + Invite Link` tag, `HD` stamp, and a dedicated preview box showing the exact message and Play Store link:
     ```text
     💊 Caught this wild drop on MEME CAPSULE! 🔥
     "<Meme Title>"

     📲 Download Meme Capsule on Google Play:
     https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.meme.capsule
     ```
2. **6 Animated Social Media Dispatch Buttons (`QUICK DISPATCH`):**
   - **WhatsApp** (`com.whatsapp`) — Animated ringing/pulsing SVG logo (`mc-anim-whatsapp`).
   - **Instagram** (`com.instagram.android`) — Animated rotating/glowing camera SVG logo (`mc-anim-insta`).
   - **Facebook** (`com.facebook.katana`) — Animated floating emblem SVG logo (`mc-anim-fb`).
   - **X (Twitter)** (`com.twitter.android`) — Animated kinetic slash SVG logo (`mc-anim-x`).
   - **Telegram** (`org.telegram.messenger`) — Animated soaring paper-plane SVG logo (`mc-anim-tg`).
   - **Discord** (`com.discord`) — Animated wobbling Clyde controller SVG logo (`mc-anim-discord`).
3. **QuickShare & More Options (`MORE OPTIONS`):**
   - Features a prominent `#FF8C00` tangerine button with an animated dots icon that immediately opens the native Android system share sheet (`Intent.createChooser`).
4. **Copy to Clipboard:**
   - Copies the promotional text, Play Store link, and image URL to the clipboard with tactile visual confirmation (`COPIED TO CLIPBOARD! ⚡`).

### 3.6 Native Android Bridge & Scoped MediaStore Storage (`MainActivity.java`)
Registered on the Android WebView as `window.MemeCapsuleAndroid`:
- **`downloadImage(String url, String fileName)`**:
  - Streams the image on a background thread into `Pictures/Meme Capsule` via Android 10+ `MediaStore.Images.Media` (`IS_PENDING` atomic write), eliminating the need for legacy storage permissions on modern Android devices.
- **`shareImage(String url, String fileName, String title)`**:
  - Formats `title` using `buildShareMessage(title)` so the Play Store link is always included, caches the image in `getCacheDir()/shared_images/` via `FileProvider`, and opens the native share chooser.
- **`shareImageToApp(String url, String fileName, String shareText, String targetPackage)`**:
  - Downloads the meme image into `FileProvider` cache (`content://com.meme.capsule.fileprovider/...`), attaches both `Intent.EXTRA_STREAM` (image URI + `ClipData`) and `Intent.EXTRA_TEXT` (promotional message + Play Store link).
  - Attempts to launch the target app directly via `targetedIntent.setPackage(targetPackage)`. If the target app is not installed on the device, it seamlessly falls back to `Intent.createChooser` so sharing never fails.
  - Supported package queries are declared in `AndroidManifest.xml` (`<queries>` for WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Telegram, Discord).

### 3.7 Meme Vault, Mood Boards ("Pinned Energy") & Offline Collections
- **Meme Vault:** Persistent offline favorites list stored in `localStorage('meme_favorites')` with instant client-side search. Free tier users can save up to 20 memes (`FREE_VAULT_LIMIT = 20`); Pro users have unlimited storage.
- **Mood Boards ("Pinned Energy"):** Color-coded thematic binders (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`) created via `CreateBoardModal.tsx`.
- **Pinboard Synchronization:** When a meme is pinned to a board, the system synchronizes both `meme_pinboard` and `meme_favorites` records to guarantee that pinned meme thumbnails always render reliably even if the meme was not previously saved to the main vault.

### 3.8 Mobile Monetization (AdMob + Google Play In-App Purchases)
- **Google AdMob:**
  - Non-intrusive full-screen interstitial ad displayed every 4th meme viewed via `@capacitor-community/admob`.
  - Rewarded ads allow users to unlock optional bonus drops.
- **Google Play In-App Purchase (Pro Tier):**
  - Product ID: `remove_ads_forever` managed via `@capgo/native-purchases`.
  - Upgrading unlocks Zero Ads, Unlimited Vault capacity, and permanent Triple Drop Mode.

### 3.9 Mobile Safety, Reporting & Local Blocklist
- **Reporting Modal (`ReportModal.tsx`):** Users can report inappropriate content (`NSFW`, `Hate Speech`, `Harassment`, `Copyright`).
- **Immediate Local Suppression:** Submitting a report triggers `POST /api/report` to Cloudflare Pages and immediately adds the meme ID to `localStorage('reported_memes')`. The client filtering loop (`fetchValidMeme()`) permanently drops reported memes from subsequent card drops.

### 3.10 Critical Engineering Guardrails & Styling Gotchas (Tailwind v4)
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 `@theme` Spacing Token Gotcha (`src/index.css`):**
   - `src/index.css` defines custom spacing tokens (`--spacing-xs: 8px`, `--spacing-sm: 16px`, `--spacing-md: 24px`, `--spacing-lg: 40px`, `--spacing-xl: 64px`).
   - In Tailwind CSS v4, utility classes like `max-w-md` or `max-w-sm` resolve to `var(--spacing-md)` (`24px`) and `var(--spacing-sm)` (`16px`).
   - **MANDATORY RULE:** Always use explicit pixel values (e.g., `max-w-[460px]`, `max-w-[500px]`, or inline `style={{ width: '100%', maxWidth: '460px' }}`) for modal and container widths rather than `max-w-md` or `max-w-sm`.
2. **Touch Events in Draggable Cards:** Always use `onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` with debounce timestamp guards and `pointer-events-none` on SVG icons for overlay action buttons.
3. **Android Build Commands:** Run `npm run lint` (`tsc --noEmit`), then `npm run build:android`, followed by `cd android && ./gradlew assembleDebug`.

---

## 5. PART C: DEVELOPER / INTERNAL BACKEND & EDGE INFRASTRUCTURE

### 5.1 Serverless Edge Infrastructure (Cloudflare Pages Functions)
The backend is completely serverless, deployed on Cloudflare Pages (`https://meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev`):
- **`GET /api/random-meme`**: Fetches a random approved meme record from D1 with strict CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`).
- **`GET /api/daily-meme`**: Deterministically selects the curated daily meme based on the current UTC date.
- **`POST /api/like`**: Atomically increments `likes_count` for a given meme ID in D1.
- **`POST /api/events`**: Ingests batched telemetry events into the D1 event queue.
- **`POST /api/report`**: Receives user safety reports and logs them in `meme_reports`.
- **`/reports`**: Serves the standalone HTML/CSS moderation dashboard for reviewing flagged content.
- **`/api/cat/*` & `/api/curate/*`**: Authenticated endpoints serving the multi-judge curation system.
- **`/api/admin/*`**: Token-protected administrative endpoints for storage syncing, SQL execution, and analytics management.

### 5.2 Cloudflare D1 Database Schemas & 3-Tier Partitioning Architecture (Migration 012)
Meme Capsule uses Cloudflare D1 (serverless SQLite). The database schema has evolved through 13 migration files (`d1/migrations/`).

#### The 3-Tier Partitioning Architecture (`curation_status`):
To prevent mixing rejected memes with uncurated backlog items, Migration 012 introduced the `curation_status` column on the `memes` table:

```text
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                            TOTAL CORPUS (5,111)                             │
├─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
│    ACTIVE (KEEP)        │      EXCLUDED           │     ARCHIVED (BACKLOG)  │
│       111 Memes         │       53 Memes          │       4,947 Memes       │
├─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
│ • status: 'active'      │ • status: 'archived'    │ • status: 'archived'    │
│ • is_active: 1          │ • is_active: 0          │ • is_active: 0          │
│ • curation_status: keep │ • curation_status: excl │ • curation_status: NULL │
│ • Eligible for Public   │ • Ineligible for Public │ • Ineligible for Public │
│   Capsule drops         │ • Admin-visible (Red)   │ • Awaiting curator rev. │
└─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
```

#### Core Database Tables:
1. **`memes` (Core Media Catalog):**
   - `id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier.
   - `url` (TEXT): Public URL in Cloudflare R2.
   - `storage_path` (TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE): R2 storage key.
   - `category` (TEXT): Primary humor category.
   - `tags` (TEXT): JSON array of string tags.
   - `rarity` (TEXT): Drop rarity (`Common`, `Rare`, `Epic`, `Legendary`).
   - `status` (TEXT): Lifecycle state (`active`, `archived`, `draft`).
   - `is_active` (INTEGER): Public delivery flag (1 = active, 0 = inactive).
   - `curation_status` (TEXT DEFAULT NULL): Explicit editorial status (`keep`, `excluded`, `duplicate`, `review_later`, or `NULL` for uncurated backlog). Added in Migration 012.
   - `random_key` (REAL): Indexed random selection helper (`abs(random()) / 9223372036854775807.0`).
   - `likes_count`, `shown_count`, `share_count` (INTEGER).
2. **`meme_curation` (Judge Consensus Votes):**
   - `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT), `meme_id` (TEXT), `curator_id` (TEXT), `corpus_status` (TEXT: `keep`, `excluded`, `duplicate`, `review_later`), `topics` (TEXT JSON), `tone` (TEXT), `humour_mechanisms` (TEXT JSON), `curator_note` (TEXT), `created_at` (DATETIME).
3. **`meme_curation_final` (SuperAdmin Authoritative Resolutions):**
   - `meme_id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), `corpus_status` (TEXT: `keep` or `excluded`), `resolved_by` (TEXT), `resolved_at` (DATETIME). Currently holds **111 keep** and **53 excluded** decisions (164 total).
4. **`cat_users` (Curator Accounts):**
   - `username` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), `password_hash` (SHA-256), `role` (`judge` or `superadmin`), `is_active` (INTEGER).
5. **`meme_reports` (Content Moderation Queue):**
   - `id` (INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT), `meme_id` (TEXT), `reason` (TEXT), `details` (TEXT), `status` (`pending`, `resolved`, `dismissed`), `created_at` (DATETIME).
6. **`content_blacklist` (Global Ban Registry):**
   - `meme_id` (TEXT PRIMARY KEY), `reason` (TEXT), `created_at` (DATETIME).
7. **`meme_events` & `meme_analytics` (Telemetry & Rankings):**
   - Event queue and aggregated engagement/virality metrics.

### 5.3 Object Storage & Media Delivery (Cloudflare R2 Bucket `memes`)
- Media assets (WebP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, MP4) reside in Cloudflare R2 bucket `memes`.
- Serves content publicly with **zero egress bandwidth charges**, edge caching, and high availability.

### 5.4 Multi-Judge Consensus & Layer 0 Keyboard Curation (`/curate`, `/categorise`)
Designed for rapid, high-volume human evaluation. Curators use Layer 0 keyboard shortcuts:
- `K`: **Keep** (Approved for public delivery).
- `E`: **Exclude** (Archived; hidden from public drops).
- `D`: **Duplicate** (Flag as duplicate with target ID).
- `L`: **Review Later** (Deferred to secondary review queue).
- `1-9, 0, -, =`: Toggle topic taxonomy.
- `Q, W, E, A, S, F`: Select humor tone.
- `Z, C, V, B, N, M, J, P, O`: Select humor mechanisms.
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Z`: Instant undo last curation decision.

### 5.5 SuperAdmin Arbitration & Authoritative Active Synchronization
When judges diverge in their votes, the meme surfaces in the **SuperAdmin Command Center**:
- **Authoritative Keep (`corpus_status = 'keep'`)**: Automatically activates the meme in `memes` (`status = 'active'`, `is_active = 1`, `curation_status = 'keep'`), registering it in the live public spawn pool (111 memes).
- **Authoritative Excluded (`corpus_status = 'excluded'`)**: Sets the meme to `status = 'archived'`, `is_active = 0`, and `curation_status = 'excluded'`, permanently isolating it from public drops while preserving it for audit (53 memes).
- **SuperAdmin KPI Metrics**: The Superadmin dashboard displays `111 ACTIVE / 5111 (164 RESOLVED)` with a dedicated badge for `53 EXCL`.
- **Public Spawn Gating**: The public delivery APIs (`/api/random-meme`, `/api/daily-meme`) strictly require an inner join on `meme_curation_final` with `corpus_status = 'keep'`, ensuring unfinalized or excluded memes can never enter user capsule drops.

### 5.6 Admin Console, 5-Metric Status Bar & SQL Runner (`/admin`)
Token-protected control center (`ADMIN_API_TOKEN`):
- **Top Stats Bar:** Displays 5 distinct metrics:
  - `TOTAL`: **5111**
  - `ACTIVE`: **111**
  - `EXCLUDED`: **53** (High-contrast red card `#FF3B30`)
  - `ARCHIVED`: **4947** (Uncurated backlog)
  - `DRAFTS`: **0**
- **Filter Tabs:** Includes `EXCLUDED (53)` filter tab alongside `ALL (5111)`, `ACTIVE (111)`, `ARCHIVED (4947)`, and `DRAFT (0)`.
- **Row Presentation:** Excluded memes display a high-visibility red `EXCLUDED` badge and strikethrough title.
- **R2 Storage Sync:** Scans R2 bucket, identifies unindexed media files, and inserts them into D1 as new meme candidates.
- **SQL Runner:** Allows administrators to execute raw SQLite queries directly against D1 with safety guards.
- **Analytics Management:** Triggers the recalculation engine and provides CSV/Excel export capabilities.

### 5.7 Token-Gated Safety Moderation & Blacklisting (`/reports`)
Standalone, token-protected dashboard rendering directly from `functions/reports.ts`:
- Lists all pending user reports from the mobile app.
- Previews the reported meme, reason (`NSFW`, `Hate Speech`, `Harassment`, `Copyright`), and reporter details.
- **Actions:**
  - *Dismiss:* Clears report as benign.
  - *Archive Meme:* Sets meme `status = 'archived'` in D1 (soft removal).
  - *Blacklist Meme:* Sets `status = 'archived'` AND permanently records the meme in `content_blacklist`.

### 5.8 Multimodal AI Pre-Curator Loop (`/ai-judge` & NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 Vision)
1. **Gemini Vision Pipeline (`/api/ai-judge/classify.ts`):** Multimodal Google Gemini Vision (`gemini-1.5-flash`) analyzes uploaded memes, extracting captions, evaluating humor mechanisms, and proposing tags.
2. **NVIDIA NIM Python Runner (`categorise.py`):** An asynchronous worker passing images to **NVIDIA NIM (Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct)** to extract OCR text, score humor mechanisms (irony, absurdity, relatability), assign tone and topic, rate rarity, and perform automated toxicity/NSFW screening before staging in D1.

### 5.9 Telemetry Pipeline & Edge Ranking Recalculation Engine
- **Client Side:** Client actions (`view`, `skip`, `like`, `share`, `download`) are enqueued into a local circular buffer and flushed every 30 seconds to `POST /api/events`.
- **Edge Side:** Events are written into `meme_events` with timestamps and session identifiers.
- **Recalculation:** The recalculation worker aggregates events across time windows, computing:
  - *Engagement Score:* Weighted combination of likes, shares, and downloads against views.
  - *Virality Score:* Ratio of external shares to total views.
  - *Skip Rate:* Percentage of views lasting under 1.5 seconds.
  - *Percentile Rankings:* Normalized scoring used for internal editorial insight.

## 6. UNIFIED NEO-BRUTALIST DESIGN SYSTEM & DESIGN TOKENS

All three codebases share a unified **Neo-Brutalist Cyber-Arcade** design language:

```text
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ Primary Font      │ Anton (Uppercase, Heavy Impact H1–H3)                  │
│ Body Font         │ Oswald / Chivo (High Legibility sans-serif)            │
│ Borders           │ Solid 2px to 4px Black or High-Voltage Accent          │
│ Box Shadows       │ Hard Offset 4px to 6px Geometric Block (No Blur)       │
└───────────────────┴────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Hard Contrast:** Eliminates subtle gradients and soft blurs in favor of stark, aggressive contrast.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Buttons physically shift (`translate-x-1 translate-y-1`) and shed their hard offset box shadows on active press, simulating a physical arcade button depress.
- **Typography:** Heavy uppercase `Anton` headings convey bold authority, supported by condensed `Oswald` body copy.

## 8. DISCREPANCY RECONCILIATION, KNOWN LIMITATIONS & RESOLVED ISSUES

### 8.1 Resolved Architectural Issues
1. **The 164 vs 111 SuperAdmin Discrepancy (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Superadmin showed `AUTHORITATIVE RESOLVED (164)` summing both keep (111) and excluded (53), while `/admin` showed `111 Active`.
   - *Resolution:* Superadmin KPI card now displays `111` (in `#34C759` green) matching `/admin Active`, with a dedicated `53 EXCL` badge.
2. **Archived vs Excluded Ambiguity (RESOLVED - Migration 012):**
   - *Previous state:* Both excluded memes (53) and uncurated backlog items (4,947) were lumped together into `status = 'archived'`.
   - *Resolution:* Added `curation_status` column to `memes`. Backfilled `curation_status = 'keep'` (111), `'excluded'` (53), and `NULL` (4,947). Added dedicated `[EXCLUDED]` filter tab and red badge to `/admin`.
3. **Drift Between `status` and `is_active` (RESOLVED - Migration 011):**
   - *Previous state:* 11 rows had mismatched `status` and `is_active` flags.
   - *Resolution:* Enforced $\text{status} = \text{'active'} \iff \text{is\_active} = 1$ across all 5,111 memes.
4. **Placeholder Screenshots on `memecapsule.wtf` (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* External placeholder generator URLs (`via.placeholder.com`).
   - *Resolution:* Replaced with 5 authentic Android app screenshots in modern WebP + JPEG format with 3D tilt and lightbox zoom.
5. **SPA Subpage 404 Routing on GitHub Pages (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Reloading `/about` or `/privacy` returned 404 errors.
   - *Resolution:* Added `vite-plugin-prerender` with deterministic `ReactSSRRenderer` and a fallback `privacy.html`.
6. **Card Touch Responsiveness During Gestures (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Touch clicks on card buttons were swallowed by `@use-gesture/react`.
   - *Resolution:* Switched overlay buttons to `onPointerDown`/`onTouchStart` with debounce timestamp guards and `pointer-events-none` on SVG icons.
7. **Service Worker Clashing in Android WebView (RESOLVED):**
   - *Previous state:* Old `sw.js` caused `Failed to fetch` errors inside Capacitor WebViews.
   - *Resolution:* Service worker registration was explicitly disabled in the mobile client.

### 8.2 Critical Engineering Constraints
1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Spacing Token Collision:**
   - In Tailwind CSS v4, custom `--spacing-*` tokens cause classes like `max-w-md` to resolve to `24px` instead of `28rem`. Always use explicit pixel widths (e.g. `max-w-[460px]`).
2. **Public Spawn Inner Join Requirement:**
   - Public APIs (`/api/random-meme`, `/api/daily-meme`) MUST enforce `INNER JOIN meme_curation_final f ON m.id = f.meme_id WHERE f.corpus_status = 'keep'`. Never bypass this gate.
3. **Zero Runtime Permissions on Android 10+:**
   - Media downloads must continue using Android `MediaStore.Images.Media` via the native Java bridge. Do not request legacy `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permissions.

## 10. CONTENT STRATEGY, ONE-LINERS & COPY KIT

### 10.1 Short & Punchy One-Liners
- **Under 10 Words:** Random memes. One tap. Zero algorithms.
- **Under 30 Words:** Meme Capsule is a free Android app that delivers hand-curated random memes with one tap. No feed, no algorithm, just pure meme chaos.
- **Under 80 Words:** Meme Capsule is an anti-algorithm entertainment app for Android that delivers hand-curated memes from a library of thousands of vetted images, supplemented by an auxiliary Reddit stream. Users tap one button to open a capsule — there is no algorithm, no tracking, and no endless scrolling. Memes can be saved to a personal offline vault, organized into mood boards, shared to any messaging app, or downloaded directly to the phone gallery.

### 10.2 Technical Pitch (For Developers / AI Agents)
> *Meme Capsule is a cross-platform content delivery ecosystem combining a Capacitor 8 native Android application (featuring a zero-permission Java MediaStore bridge and 4-card 3D perspective spring stack), a Cloudflare Pages serverless edge backend querying Cloudflare D1 SQLite and R2 object storage with zero egress fees and 3-tier status partitioning, a multimodal vision AI pre-judging pipeline (Gemini Vision and NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 11B Vision), and a multi-page neo-brutalist React web presence with deterministic static prerendering.*

```text
=== PORTABLE CONTEXT: MEME CAPSULE (ALL THREE CODEBASES) ===
APP NAME: Meme Capsule
PACKAGE ID: com.meme.capsule
CURRENT ANDROID VERSION: v2.7 (versionCode 18)
OFFICIAL WEBSITES: https://memecapsule.wtf (Web Platform) | https://meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev (Edge Backend)
DEVELOPER: Pratham Pandey (memecapsule.app@gmail.com)

ECOSYSTEM STRUCTURE:
1. PUBLIC MOBILE APP (com.meme.capsule):
   - Tech: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6, Tailwind CSS v4, Capacitor 8 Android container.
   - Core UX: 4-card 3D perspective spring deck (@react-spring/web, @use-gesture/react), 7-meme FIFO prefetch buffer, instant-touch 38x38 overlay buttons (onPointerDown with debounce), 4-button CTA bar (LIKE, VAULT, PIN, SHARE).
   - Viral Sharing: Neo-Brutalist Share Sheet with live thumbnail preview, auto-attached Play Store link, 6 animated social media SVGs (WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook, X, Telegram, Discord), QuickShare, More Options (#FF8C00 native chooser).

   - Collections & Monetization: Meme Vault (free limit 20, Pro unlimited), Mood Boards, AdMob interstitials (every 4th drop), In-App Purchase (₹99 remove_ads_forever).

2. PUBLIC WEB PLATFORM (memecapsule.wtf):
   - Tech: React 18, Vite 5, Tailwind CSS v3, React Router DOM v6, static HTML prerendering (vite-plugin-prerender with ReactSSRRenderer) on GitHub Pages.
   - Core Features: Live Drop Simulator (5-drop quota + lockout bumper with Play Store UTM tracking), 3D interactive phone mockups (5 authentic WebP captures + lightbox zoom), Kage atmospheric UI (Preloader, CustomCursor, GrainOverlay, Vignette, ScrollRail), Acid Glitch mode (html.theme-glitch), Section 04.5 Under the Hood, /about Press Kit (copy kit & brand downloads), /privacy policy, Formspree contact form (xwlenwzr with privacy consent), Google AdSense unit meme1 (slot 6291908699, ca-pub-2093403233028868), and SEO/GEO (llms.txt, Schema.org).

3. SERVERLESS EDGE BACKEND & INTERNAL WORKBENCHES (meme-capsule-eww.pages.dev - This Repo):
   - Tech: Cloudflare Pages Functions, Cloudflare D1 (SQLite with 13 migrations), Cloudflare R2 (bucket memes, $0.00 egress).
   - 3-Tier Status Partitioning (Migration 012):
     * curation_status = 'keep' (111 memes, status = 'active', is_active = 1) -> Live in public Capsule drops.
     * curation_status = 'excluded' (53 memes, status = 'archived', is_active = 0) -> Authoritatively rejected by Superadmin.
     * curation_status IS NULL (4,947 memes, status = 'archived', is_active = 0) -> Uncurated backlog.
     * Total Corpus: 5,111 memes.
   - Internal Tools (Neo-Brutalist dark theme #121212, Anton/Oswald fonts):
     * /curate & /categorise: Multi-judge consensus curation with Layer 0 keyboard shortcuts (K, E, D, L) and SuperAdmin conflict arbitration.
     * /admin: 5-metric status bar (Total 5111, Active 111, Excluded 53, Archived 4947, Drafts 0), dedicated [EXCLUDED] filter tab, D1/R2 sync, SQL runner, analytics recalculation.
     * /reports: Token-gated moderation dashboard for user-flagged memes (archive / blacklist).
     * /ai-judge: Multimodal vision loop (Gemini Vision + NVIDIA NIM Llama 3.2 Vision runner) for pre-curation recommendations.
   - Note: Old pastel root landing UI (App.tsx, styles.css) has been REMOVED. Default route / serves <CurateApp />.

CRITICAL RULES & CONSTRAINTS:
1. STRICT INTEGRITY: The public spawn query strictly requires INNER JOIN on meme_curation_final WHERE corpus_status = 'keep'. Unfinalized or excluded memes must never spawn.
2. NO ALGORITHMS: The public delivery philosophy is anti-algorithmic serendipity. Never add recommendation algorithms.
3. TAILWIND V4 GOTCHA: In Tailwind v4, custom --spacing-* tokens cause max-w-md to resolve to 24px. Always use explicit pixel widths (e.g. max-w-[460px]).
4. CLEAR CODEBASE BOUNDARIES: Maintain strict separation between Mobile APK, Promo Web, and Edge Backend.
